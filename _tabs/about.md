My name is Frank Pejril, and throughout the years I have worn many hats. While I am -- and continue to be -- a student of the world (always stay curious!), I've taken on many responsibilities and areas of specialization over the years. My major roles have been as:

- A High School Maths Teacher
- A Cloud Operations/DevOps Engineer
- A Revenue Operations Data Analyst
- A Salesforce Administrator

If you'd like to learn a little more about me, read on!

## A Passion for Technology
I've been tinkering with computers and configuration since I had my first eMachine desktop in 2003. From making regular hardware upgrades, to pushing the boundaries of the software I use, and building my own "dream setup" (and rebuilding it several times over). I've always had an interest in technology, and I love to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in both hardware and software.

## Education Background
Out of high school, my goal was to make a career out of Mathematics -- specifically in education. It was always my strongest subject (though I also love Chemistry and Physics, for similar reasons), and among my friends I was the go-to person for guidance when it came to maths. I found the logical structure of maths came natural to me, and I could build a mental map in my mind -- from the fundamental concepts, through the nomenclature, to the more challenging concepts -- which gave me a firm grasp in many areas of the subject. 

I started my undergrad education at Purdue University right out of high school in 2013. While the goal of the program was to get my teaching license and land a job as a High School maths teacher, the coursework certainly had me going through the ropes. Some of the more challenging courses ended up being my favorites -- topics like Linear & Abstract Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, Logic, Statistics, Geometry, and Real Analysis proved to be very challenging, but equally rewarding. 

The coursework had a very strong focus on rigorous logical proof in challenging areas, and I found a love for the process of translating axiomatic concepts through lower-level abstractions (theorems) to become higher-level abstractions. I think this process of using intuitive understandings through a ladder of abstractions to become less-intuitive but more impactful truths of the world lent itself well to my soon-to-be blooming career in technology.

As part of the Mathematics coursework at Purdue, I also got a firm background in programming, even if it wasn't directly applicable to my career goal at the time. I learned object-oriented programming through Python and Java, and built a few projects as part of the coursework, but I didn't make much else of this until several years later, after I had graduated and entered the workforce in earnest.

## Teaching Maths
I graduated in 2017, hitting that sweet-spot 4-year college program, and soon after landed my first teaching job for the 2017-2018 school year.

## Entering the Tech Industry
While I was still in university I was working part-time jobs to make sure I stayed out of debt from student loans. I can happily say that debt was avoided entirely, thanks to the financial aid I received from academic scholarships, my frugal choice of dormatory and meal plan, my part-time work, and the savings my family had set aside when I was born which grew into a proper college fund. I will certainly be doing the same for my own children when the time comes!

In the summer of 2016, prior to my final year of college, I was in search of a more engaging role. I had been working in pizza delivery for a couple of years at that point, which *was* engaging and funhad me building several great. My mother -- who has been working in the web sphere for my entire life -- suggested I apply for an internship at her company, Homefinder. I had already built some rapport with the Homefinder team in prior summers, when I had taken on temporary roles inventorying their IT and office supplies, wiping and rebuilding employee devices (mostly MacBooks), and chatting with the team there.
