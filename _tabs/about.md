## 👋 Hi, I’m Frank

I’m a **Cloud Operations & DevOps Engineer** with a passion for automation, observability, and infrastructure that scales. I’ve spent most of my career optimizing CI/CD pipelines, hardening deployments, and making systems more reliable — both in the cloud and in my homelab. If you're curious about how I got started, you can [read more about my background here]({{ "/posts/getting-my-start/" | relative_url }}).

### 🔧 What I Do
- 🛠️ Design and maintain CI/CD workflows for microservices
- 🌩️ Automate infrastructure and configuration with modern tooling
- 🔍 Build observability systems for faster issue resolution
- 🧪 Experiment with open source projects and self-hosted services

### 🏡 Homelab Life
Though I’ve long been cloud-native in my work, running bare metal has deepened my skills and broadened my perspective. My homelab gives me a place to experiment — whether with orchestration, self-hosting, or network design — and I’m excited to share more of that journey here.
