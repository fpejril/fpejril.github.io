I'm **Frank Pejril**, a Cloud and DevOps Engineer with nearly a decade of experience helping organizations modernize infrastructure, improve deployment pipelines, and secure mission-critical environments.

I specialize in building and maintaining cloud-native systems. My background includes work with **CI/CD pipelines**, **Container Orchestration**, **Infrastructure as Code**, and **Observability Tooling**. I also have a strong foundation in systems automation and root-cause analysis, along with a practical understanding of modern security principles.

Over the years, I've led complex cloud migrations, reduced operational costs through automation and resource optimization, and delivered production-ready environments that scale reliably under load.

### Areas of Expertise

- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible, Puppet)
- Cloud Architecture (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions, CodeBuild, Octopus Deploy)
- Container Orchestration (ECS, Kubernetes, Docker)
- Observability (Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana)
- Scripting and Automation (Python, Shell)
- DevOps culture and cross-functional team enablement

### Values I Work By

- **Automation over repetition.**
- **Security-first thinking.**
- **Simple, scalable solutions.**
- **Clear communication and documentation.**
- **Continuous learning and iteration.**
