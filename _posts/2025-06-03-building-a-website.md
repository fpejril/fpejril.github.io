Today I'm starting my journey of creating a public-facing portfolio to track and link to my activities for all to see. Much of my tech career has been behind the scenes, and many of my projects proprietary to the businesses I've worked for, but it's about time I start making a public face for all of my accomplishments and work.

I don't have much else to add here for now, but keep an eye out in the coming days and weeks to see where this site goes! Right now I'll be hosting this on [frankpejril.com](https://frankpejril.com) with GitHub Pages, and I'm learning the ins and outs of web development with Jekyll (the default platform on which GitHub pages functions). I may choose some other platform and framework for web hosting in the future -- much of my past experience has been in WordPress, but that's a beast of its own. For now, I think this will be the easiest way to make my activities open to the world.
