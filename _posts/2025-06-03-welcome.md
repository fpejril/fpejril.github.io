After years of working behind the scenes on infrastructure, cloud architecture, and DevOps automation, I’ve decided it’s time to share more of my work publicly.

This site will serve as a home for my portfolio, writing, and project documentation. It’s where I’ll publish insights from the field, showcase the tools I build, and reflect on what I’m learning along the way. While much of my past work has been proprietary to the companies I’ve supported, I’m excited to start making more of my ideas and practices visible here.

This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). It’s simple, fast, and easy to maintain—perfect for keeping the focus on content. Over time, I may migrate to another platform, but for now, this setup strikes a good balance of control and simplicity.

Want to know more about me and what I do? Check out the [About page](/about/).

Thanks for stopping by—and stay tuned.
