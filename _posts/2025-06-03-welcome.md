Want to know more about me and what I do? Check out the [About page](/about/).

This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). It’s simple, fast, and easy to maintain—perfect for keeping the focus on content. Over time, I may migrate to another platform, but for now, this setup strikes a good balance of control and simplicity.

Thanks for stopping by—and stay tuned.
